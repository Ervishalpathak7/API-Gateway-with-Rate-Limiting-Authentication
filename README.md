# API Gateway with Rate Limiting & Authentication

## Tech Stack:
- **Java**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **Spring Security**
- **OAuth2**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- **Redis**
- **REST**
- **gRPC**

---

## Overview

This project implements a secure and scalable **API Gateway** using **Spring Cloud Gateway** to efficiently manage authentication, rate limiting, and request routing for microservices. It ensures that backend services are properly secured and are able to handle traffic in a highly controlled and efficient manner.

---

## Problem Solved

This API Gateway solution addresses the following key concerns:
1. **Authentication & Authorization:** Using **JWT** and **OAuth2**, the API Gateway ensures secure access control, preventing unauthorized access to microservices.
2. **Rate Limiting:** Implemented with the **Token Bucket Algorithm** using **Redis**, rate limiting is enforced to prevent abuse and ensure fair access to services.
3. **Support for REST & gRPC:** The gateway efficiently routes both **REST** and **gRPC** requests, enabling seamless communication between various microservices.

---

## Project Advantages

- **Centralized Authentication:** The API Gateway manages authentication, allowing for a consistent, centralized approach to securing microservices using **JWT** and **OAuth2**.
- **Fine-grained Rate Limits:** Redis-based rate limiting offers fine-grained control over API usage, ensuring that services are not overwhelmed by excessive requests.
- **Scalable & Secure Architecture:** This approach ensures that backend services can scale effectively while maintaining security and efficiency through centralized traffic management.
- **Seamless Communication:** With support for both **REST** and **gRPC**, the API Gateway offers flexible and efficient communication mechanisms for diverse microservice architectures.

---

## Features

- **Authentication:** OAuth2-based security with JWT tokens for user identity verification and authorization.
- **Rate Limiting:** Redis-backed rate limiting with a Token Bucket algorithm to prevent abuse and ensure fairness in API consumption.
- **Request Routing:** Efficient routing of REST and gRPC requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error messages and status codes to manage authentication failures, rate limit violations, and other issues.
- **Metrics & Monitoring:** Integration with monitoring tools to keep track of API usage, request counts, and performance metrics.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11+**
- **Maven** (for building the project)
- **Redis** (for rate limiting)
- **OAuth2 provider** (e.g., Google, GitHub, custom OAuth2 server)
- **Spring Boot 2.x** (and related dependencies)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-gateway-with-rate-limiting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd api-gateway-with-rate-limiting
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Configure Redis for rate limiting by ensuring it's running and accessible at the default port (`6379`).

5. Set up the OAuth2 configuration, specifying the authorization server and client details in `application.yml`.

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

7. The API Gateway will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

Here are some example API endpoints that the gateway manages:

- **Authentication:**
  - `POST /auth/login` – Obtain a JWT token for authentication.
  - `POST /auth/refresh` – Refresh an expired JWT token.

- **Rate Limited API:**
  - `GET /api/v1/resource` – Access a rate-limited resource, subject to token bucket rate limiting.

- **gRPC Services:**
  - gRPC endpoints are available for internal microservice communication. Example:
    - `GreeterService.SayHello` – Simple gRPC-based greeting service.

---

## Configuration

You can customize the application by modifying the `application.yml` configuration file:

- **OAuth2 settings**: Configure the authentication provider, client IDs, and secrets.
- **Rate Limiting**: Define the maximum request rate per user or IP using Redis and Token Bucket settings.

Example:

```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          google:
            client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
            client-secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
            scope: profile, email
            redirect-uri: "{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}"
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: service-a
          uri: lb://SERVICE-A
          predicates:
            - Path=/service-a/**
        - id: service-b
          uri: lb://SERVICE-B
          predicates:
            - Path=/service-b/**
  redis:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
    timeout: 5000
```

---

## Testing

You can test the API Gateway by sending requests using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.

1. **Login and Obtain JWT:**
   ```bash
   POST /auth/login
   Body: { "username": "user", "password": "password" }
   Response: { "access_token": "jwt-token" }
   ```

2. **Access a Rate-Limited Resource:**
   ```bash
   GET /api/v1/resource
   Headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer jwt-token" }
   Response: 200 OK (if within rate limit)
   ```
